          ENSAE stands for Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse
          Economique / National School of Statistics and Economics Analysis.
          Here is the <a href="https://www.ensae.sn/">link</a> for those who
          might be interested to know more about ENSAE and its programs.

        <p>
          I am a Statistical Engineering and Economics student at
          <b>ENSAE Dakar</b>, currently in my fifth and final year. Alongside my
          studies, I contribute to the
          <b>Bureau of the Togolese Students Association</b> and the
          <b>Informatics Club</b> at ENSAE.
        </p>

          My interests span statistical modeling,
         machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a
          strong enthusiasm for software and game development. I'm
          particularly passionate about developing
         new machine learning models that balance
         predictive performance and interpretability, especially
          for applications in many diverse fields like Health, Climate and Agricultural Data, Transport...
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond applied research, I'm also really passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Machines construction.
          Especially, the question "Will human being be able to develop a human-like or even super-human-like intelligence?" is a question that thrills
          me and motivates me to go in ML/AI related fields. Ultimately, I will help humanity find answers to this question.

                <img src="img/pneumonia.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
                <p>In this project, we applied the CNN architecture and anomaly detection algorithms to classify lungs xray
                    images as viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia or normal.
